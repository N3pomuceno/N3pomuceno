<!--Hi, I'm N3pomuceno(he/him), a Brazilian guy running after knowledge. I am graduated in Physics at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) in 2021 and now I am taking the Information Systems course, with the intention of pursuing a career as a data scientist.

I have good experience with Python language and I like working with Jupyter Notebook to analyze datasets. I also have a slight mastery of C/C++ from my college work.

I'm interested in becoming a data scientist working with Machine Learning. I want to practice a lot so that I can become good and efficient!

If you can help me to grow, giving tips and ways to improve my code, I will be very grateful.

Fun fact: Sudoku and chess are my favorite hobbies!
